# Age-and-Gender-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
Automatic prediction of age and gender from face images has drawn a lot of attention
recently, due it is wide applications in various facial analysis problems. However, due to the
large intra-class variation of face images ,the existing models are still behind the desired accuracy
level, which is necessary for the use of these models in real-world applications. Using attention
mechanism enables our model to focus on the important and informative parts of the face, which
can help it to make a more accurate prediction. We train our model in a multi-task learning
fashion, and augment the feature embedding of the age classifier, with the predicted gender, and
show that doing so can further increase the accuracy of age prediction. Our model is trained on
a popular face age and gender dataset, and achieved promising results. In this project, we are
going to use Deep Learning framework, based on the ensemble of attentional and residual
convolutional networks, to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from the image of
a face. The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘female’ and the predicted age is in the
range of (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100). Here we
will use the Adience dataset.
